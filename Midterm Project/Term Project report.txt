Midterm Report
        
Application 1: Sorted Array by age.
-Big O
	Creation: O(n)
	Destroy: O(1)
	Search: O(log(n))
	Insertion: O(n)
	Deletion: O(n)
	maxAgeGap: O(1)
Even though it has large Big O complexity, because application 1 focused on the maxAgeGap function, sorted array is one of the options that provide a Big O(1). 


Application 2: Direct Hashing by ID. 
-Big O
        Creation: O(n)
	Destroy: O(1)
	Search: O(1)
	Insertion: O(1)
	Deletion: O(1)
Direct hashing is the best option for application 2 because it provides the best Big O for all functions.
